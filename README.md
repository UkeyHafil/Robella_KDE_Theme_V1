please be wary that i'm not github master, coding is not my priority yet. so i'm apologize for this mess

i have updated this github wih updated stuff and this is officially one of my fully customize theme. since this is V1. dont expect too much with hyprland, rofi ect.
Here is the konsave file: https://limewire.com/d/3B8uF#Oxkv7wV7Hn 
all below here is gui guides for todo the files.
and check "show hidden files" on the file manager settings

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where to put the files: 

.bashrc > /home/
sm > /home/.conky/simple media
config.jsonc > /home/.config/fastfetch

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Todo if you need to change the logo after downloading the file:

1. put the config.jsonc to home/.config/fastfetch (create the fastfetch folder if there are nothing)
2. find some picture you like and put the file in the same place as config.jsonc
3. double click config.jsonc to edit the file
4. find logo source on upper line (line 5) and change the robella.png to your picture name (with extension)
5. save and open terminal you're using to open fastfetch

if the picture you use is too big, change the logo height below the "source" line

how to use the conky

1. go to conky directory (/home/.conky) to create the new folder. name it "simple media"
2. after downloading the file, put it inside the simple media folder
3. open conky manager to enable the media by check the file
4. if there some misfit because the resolution difference,open the sm file and change the gap_x and gap_y value to fit desktop screen. since mine is using 1080p screen
